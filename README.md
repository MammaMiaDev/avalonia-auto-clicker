Simply press F6 on your keyboard to start/stop the auto-clicker.
You can set the delay between clicks based on your needs.

Core functionalities are provided by the [SharpHook](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook) library.

Notes:
On Mac, you might be asked to grant accessibility permissions to the app. That is required to intercept global keyboard events and to simulate mouse clicks.
